This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js. The problem arises when you try to use a Tailwind CSS utility class that isn't included in your CSS output file.  This often happens when you're using a class that's been added in a new Tailwind version or a class that's been removed due to a purge/optimization strategy. This can also happen with custom classes that were not correctly configured to purge in production mode.
